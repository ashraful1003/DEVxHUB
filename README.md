# DEVxHUB

This project is an assignment for DEVxHUB recruitment.

## Getting Started

It is a good journey so far. Though I could do better but some error managements killed my massive time like firebase firestore. However, below I am enlisting my done job so far.  UI/UX design is not overwhelm as I do not want to lose my time searching best UI/UX design. 
State Management: GetX
Architecture: MVC Pattern

1.	User Authentication: Implementation Firebase Authentication for user registration and login are completed. Though email verification has been implemented, but main task is done. Overall error management is done but individual text-fields have not been managed from error. And obviously, if a user is already logged in, he will be redirected from splash screen.
 
    
2.	Home Screen: After the user logs in, the home screen is displaying a grid of products retrieved from a mock API. There is a category bar over the product lists and we can go every category and sort the products as per category.
             
3.	Product Details Screen: When a user taps on a product, navigate to a details screen that displays more information about the product. Users are able to add the product to their shopping cart from this screen. This feature is also integrated! 
4.	Shopping Cart: Implementation shopping cart where users can view, add, and delete items is partially done. I mean, so far user can only view the added products and price can be upgraded but it is not updating in database. Cart data should persist across app launches.
                
5.	Checkout: Yet not integrated!
6.	Order History: Yet not integrated!
7.	Search Functionality: UI is implemented but yet not integrated!
8.	Push Notifications: Yet not integrated!
9.	Offline Mode: Yet not integrated!
